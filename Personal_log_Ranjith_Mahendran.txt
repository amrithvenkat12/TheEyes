Logbook Ranjith Mahendran:

Week 45:
    * Project Start.
    * Joined the GitLab workspace and helped set the initial files.
    * Installed Ubuntu 16.04 for on Oracle Virtual box.Lagging perfomance of cpu and responce time. 
    
Week 46:
    * Tryed to install Ubuntu as a boot OS along with Windows 10.
    * Bios issue on boot up. Pc corrupted windows boot file, hence prefered to stay working on virtual machine.
    * The QR code types were analysed and various available applications online and on phone were tested. 
    * A working python Library and associated code snippets were obtained and tried on Python on the Ubuntu OS.
    

Week 47:
    * Developed a code that could detect QR codes and tried incorporating data matrix detection.
    * There was a lag in reading data matrix codes along with QR, as requirement was only QR we removed the data matrix dectetion.
    
Week 48:
    * The team met at Juan's home for everybody to install Ubuntu and make it work.
    * Tried to implement QR code detection alog with basic lane detection code.
    * Sought help from friends in India to get us started with the simulation basics (i.e the components needed to bring in models into Gazebo).
    * Worked on bringing new objects and world configurations in Gazebo. Created models in Creo which were only importable as .stl files and without color.

Week 49 & Week 50:
    * Group subgoal achieved- QR code detection.
    * Moved on to working on Gazebo and ROS simulation parts.
    * Managed to secure Student license for Solidworks so that we could model our own track.
    * Less progress in importing a World file.
    * Faced issues in implementing readily available packages that could simulate a car due to OS and Gazebo version constraints. Had to browse for alternatives.
    
Week 51:
    * Me, Amrith and Malik met up at Malik's house and pondered over Gazebo.
    * Downloaded Blender to aid adding color to the model.
    * Learned to add physical contraints to Gazebo model files.

Week 52 2019 and week 1 2020 (Holidays):
    * Built a crude race track in Solidworks. Used Blender to make the colourful outputs.
    * Tried to implement the same model in Gazebo along with the Ackermann Steering model.
    * Succesful in importing both models but severe constraints in terms of outlook of the track model and functional constraints with Ackermann steering model.
    
Week 2:
    * The car is now able to identify the lines and QR code.
    * The simulation failed as the models could not be imported with the desired color to implement autonomity.
