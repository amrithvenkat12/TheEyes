Reccommendation: Record a video from the onboard camera of the car going through either the simulatin or a real track. WIll use this video to try out the codes as in the video.


What color are the lanes Vs what color is the background?


HoughLanesP code from OpenCV seems to be an useful function to detect lines given some parameters.

Once the lanes are found, it is necesary to determine by geometry some directional vectors. 

We can either do calculations ahead in time and predict curves or go through them on the run by running a code to keep the image centered.


1) Get the video.
2) Crop in the area of interest
3) apply flters to reduce noise if necessary.
4) Create functions to detct lanes using OpenCV library.
5) Once the lanes are found, determine the geometry of them. Draw directional vectors.
6) By doing math, determine the focus point of the curve.
7) Do geometry conversion and turn each wheel to match the curve focus in an Ackerman Steering System.
8) Pray that it works.
