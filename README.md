First and beforehand, we want to thank Ross Kippenbrock for the "Finding Lane Lines for Self Driving Cars" video. His explanation is incredibly good and helped us.
You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyLihutdsPk

We also want to thank Li Wang for uploading a Lane Detection algorithm and making it publicly available. He has also, referenced those codes he used as well. You can find the code here: https://github.com/liwangGT/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines
Also he has a YouTube video here with the running program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8QN-qY7uIo

With that said, welcome to our Lane Detection Project. The main goal here is detect lanes in a racing track utilizing the ADAS car and its camera. https://www.digitalwerk.net/adas-modellauto/

In a brief, we took Li Wang's code, migrated it into ROS platform and adjusted many things to make it work live on the ADAS car.

If you are in need of a similar project running on ROS or using Machine Vision, feel free to use this code.
